description: Documents core data flow patterns between service validation, testimonial management and service categorization components

# data-flow-architecture

Core data flows connect three main business domains:

## Service Definition Flow
`src/config/site.ts` → `src/components/sections/ServiceAreas.tsx`
- Service definitions with categorization flow to geographic validation
- Equipment requirements propagate to service area availability checks
- Surface type specifications inform regional service boundaries

## Review Data Pipeline 
`src/components/sections/Testimonials.tsx` ← `src/config/site.ts`
- Service categories map to filtered review subsets
- Review rotation driven by service type correlations
- Testimonial display logic consumes service definitions

## Availability Management Flow
`src/config/site.ts` → Multiple Components
- Seasonal adjustments affect service area calculations
- Time slot availability flows into geographic boundary logic
- Service type restrictions propagate to scheduling components

## Geographic Data Flow
`src/components/sections/ServiceAreas.tsx`
- Dynamic radius calculations feed service validation
- Region-specific rules determine final availability
- Boundary data interfaces with scheduling constraints

Key Integration Points:
- Service definitions drive both area validation and review filtering
- Geographic boundaries influence scheduling availability
- Equipment mappings affect service area determinations

Domain Importance Score: 65/100
- Moderate complexity in business domain integration
- Service-specific validation chains
- Location-based availability rules
