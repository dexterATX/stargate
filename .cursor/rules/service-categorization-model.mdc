# service-categorization-model

The service categorization model implements a hierarchical classification system for pressure washing services with the following key components:

## Core Structure
`src/config/site.ts` defines the primary service organization:

- Service Type Classification
  - Surface-specific categorization
  - Equipment requirement mappings
  - Service area associations

- Service Availability Rules
  - Seasonal adjustments
  - Type-specific scheduling constraints
  - Operational time slots

## Service Reviews Integration
`src/components/sections/Testimonials.tsx` maintains:

- Review-to-service type correlation
- Service-specific review categorization
- Categorized display logic

## Geographic Service Boundaries
`src/components/sections/ServiceAreas.tsx` implements:

- Service area coverage model
- Regional availability validation
- Service radius definitions per category

Importance Score: 60
Primary business value stems from organizing service offerings and maintaining service-specific operational rules while providing moderate domain complexity.
